# Microsoft-Evangelists
Source code for a website that lists Microsoft Technical Evangelsts and MVPs. Currently focussed on UK evangelists but can be expanded.

Written in ASP.net Core 1.0 and driven off a simple JSON file that is embedded in the solution.

The live site is at http:/aka.ms/TechnicalSpeakers
